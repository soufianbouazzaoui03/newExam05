Name: bigint  
Files: bigint.cpp, bigint.hpp

In computer science, a bignum is an object representing an arbitrary precision number. 
This is useful when you want to store a number bigger than SIZE_MAX without any loss of precision. 
This is often achieved by storing an array or a string containing the different parts of the numbers.

Create a class bigint that will store an arbitrary precision unsigned integer.

Your class must support addition, comparison, and "digitshift" 
(like bitshift but instead of shifting the bits, you will shift the digits in base 10, e.g., (42 << 3 = 42000) and (1337 >> 2 = 13).

Your bigInt must be printable with the << operation (in base 10) and output shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.

You will find a main in the directory that must work with your class.
